This error means that you have a foreign key constraint (Categories_userId_foreign_idx) that still references the userId column in the Categories table, even though you've removed that column. This is a common issue when modifying database schemas.

Here's how to fix it:

    Drop the foreign key constraint: You need to drop the foreign key constraint that is causing the error. You can do this using the following SQL statement:
    SQL

ALTER TABLE Categories DROP FOREIGN KEY Categories_userId_foreign_idx;

(Optional) Drop the index: If there is an index associated with the foreign key constraint, you might also want to drop it:
SQL

    DROP INDEX Categories_userId_foreign_idx ON Categories; 

Explanation:

    Foreign key constraints: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity between tables. They prevent you from deleting or updating records in one table if there are related records in another table that depend on them.
    Dropping constraints: When you remove a column that is referenced by a foreign key constraint, you need to explicitly drop the constraint first. Otherwise, the database will not allow you to remove the column.

Important notes:

    Table names: Make sure to replace Categories with the actual name of your categories table if it's different.
    Constraint name: The constraint name (Categories_userId_foreign_idx) might be different in your database. You can find the exact name by inspecting the table structure in DBeaver or by querying the information_schema.table_constraints table.
    Sequelize: If you're using Sequelize, you can remove the association between the Categories and Users models in your model definitions. Then, when you run sequelize.sync({ alter: true }), Sequelize will automatically drop the foreign key constraint in the database.

After dropping the foreign key constraint, you should be able to successfully sync your models with the database without encountering the error.
