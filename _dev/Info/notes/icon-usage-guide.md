# Icon Implementation Guide

## Unicode Symbols vs SVG Icons

### Unicode Symbols

Unicode symbols (also known as glyphs or characters) are text characters that render as icons.

#### Advantages

- **Lightweight**: Single characters instead of complex XML/path data
- **System Performance**: Treated as text, requiring minimal rendering resources
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Supported by all modern browsers
- **Scalability**: Scales smoothly with font-size
- **Easy Implementation**: Can be used directly in text/HTML
- **No Asset Loading**: Part of text rendering, no external resources needed
